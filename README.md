JJ's Music Release 2020-08
=========================

Introduction
------------

Hi. I am a bit nervous about this. I put some of my old songs on Spotify. It is electronic music. I made them in the 90's. It was just to have something to do. It may not be of much interest to the general public, but at least they are online now.

DJayJ - OLDMUS~1

Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/album/1p9IeYN5QNzzDAeZZTfkFz
Deezer: https://www.deezer.com/en/album/169760312
iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/id1529321181?app=itunes

I picked out 7 songs. Next to Spotify, they're also on Deezer and the iTunes store and others. A company called EmuBands put them there for me. It cost me about 65 euros. If the music would get listened to a lot, it is supposed to make me earn money, but we'll see. :D

If you might choose to use EmuBands, you could use the following promo code:
  NXS7VERB
It would cost you nothing, but may help me earn cash :D


Goal
----

### Songs

I would like to release 7 or 8 songs I made in the 90's. Just to share it online.
Content/songs may be copied from an earlier project "The CD 2005".

### Costs

It may not matter how good the music is. I do not need to make money from it or have it cost me any money. However, if there is money to be made, I might want to collect it.

### Hassle

I would like it to not be too much hassle, since I might not be able to handle that.

### 2020-08-30 Done Remaining Details

- [x] EmuBands might link to a Spotify artist when I supply: Spotify Artist URI and Spotify Album URI.
    - [x] Spotify Artist URI: spotify:artist:46AyONQpbI30MnhrRuhX1o
    - [x] Spotify Album URI: spotify:album:1p9IeYN5QNzzDAeZZTfkFz
- [x] I might ask what this Mastering thing is mentioned on their site.
- [x] Waiting for a response from EmuBands.

### 2020-08-19 Done Researching

Might choose songs first before best pricing plan may become clear.

Might research the following criteria for each distributor:

- [x] One-off fee?
- [x] Multiple platforms?
- [x] Royalty handling.
- [x] Hassle.
- [x] Price for what I want.
- [x] Researched one more distributor (RouteNote)
- [x] Misc conditions.

### 2020-08-22 Done Reading Terms of Service of EmuBands

> "The Client will be responsible for obtaining and holding all consents, licences, permits and other similar instruments applicable to material it supplies to EmuBands for incorporation into the Work, including without limitation copyrights, trademarks, logos, patents and all such similar instruments."

- I am just not sure what that means I should do.
- I might assume I do not have to do anything. I think it might apply to usage of others' materials. Hmm... I used samples.

> "The Client will be responsible for payment of Mechanical Royalties on sales from certain territories including but not limited to Mexico (for downloads up to and including December 2017), USA, Canada, Pakistan and India. EmuBands will use best endeavours to assist Client in assessing their Mechanical Royalties liability."

- Does that mean I have to pay more than their fees?
- I think I will let this doubt go.

> "The Client warrants and represents to EmuBands that any element of text, graphics, photos, designs, trademarks or other material supplied to EmuBands for inclusion in the Work are owned by the client, or that the client has permission from the rightful owner to use each of these elements and that EmuBands use of such material shall not infringe the intellectual property rights of any third party."

- I hope the samples I used don't mess things up.
- I looked up some US law on it. It seems I might fall under the reasonable use thing.

> "The prices charged initially"

- So what costs am I to expect additionally? If it is much, I might regard that 'hassle' I was not hoping for.
- The main web page says 'no nasty hidden costs', so I think I might have to just trust that.

### 2020-08-19 Done Adapting Songs

Adapting the songs may cost me much energy, but it may also turn out to be something nice to keep busy with.

- [x] "Testag": More mono
    - Maybe convert to mono or make 'more mono'. The harsh stereo separation makes is difficult to bear for my hearing.
- [x] "Tryout5": Longer
    - Make longer by repetition?
- [x] "O08V2": Slower
    - Might want to make it a bit slower.
- [x] "NostGoo2"
- [x] Bussel2
    - Recording again in Impulse Tracker with 128 sample channels instead of 64.

### 2020-08-22 Done Adapting Song "Testag": Make More Mono

The harsh stereo separation makes it difficult to bear for my hearing.

Possible steps:

- [x] Trying mixing 50% of opposite channel into each channel.
    - [x] Using Audacity.
    - [x] Making a copy, switching channels.
    - [x] Using Audacity's Effect Adjustable Fade:
    - [x] Reducing volume to 50% on the copy with switched channels.
    - [x] Reducing total volume of both wavs to 66%
        - (I have 150% volume now. So a factor of 1.5. I may need multiply all by 1 / 1.5 = 66%)
    - [x] Mixing together the two copies.
        - [x] Using Audacity
        - [x] Tracks: Add New: Stereo Track
        - [x] Paste
        - [x] Select both tracks
        - [x] Tracks: Mix: Mix and Render
- [x] Listening to result
- [x] Listening to part of original.
- [x] I would like to try to make the stereo more pronounced.
- [x] Trying mixing 20% of opposite channel into each channel, instead of 50%.
    - [x] Taking similar steps as above.
    - [x] But reducing total volume of both copies to 83.3%

### 2020-08-23 Done Adapting Song "Laughing Baby" ("Tryout5"): Make Longer?

The song might be a bit funny / silly, but also I am inspired to start moving/dancing in the middle, so it may have some value there.

Maybe edit with Audacity. This may save me from going into trouble with Impulse Tracker which may come with surprises.

- [x] Last 3 pattern repetitions fade out.
- [x] An idea might be to repeat the whole thing twice.
- [x] ~~Starting the second repeat mixed together with the previous fade out.~~
- [x] ~~Another idea might be to (partially) fade in the second repeat.~~
- [x] ~~It might create a certain energy elevation too in the middle~~
- [x] Just cutting off after the first fade out pattern and starting the song anew may seem more natural.
- [x] Might first listen to the whole result up until now.
- [x] I think one of the first patterns from the second repeat might be trimmed away.
- [x] It just seems to me some drum-free patterns in the second repeat might make you stop dancing.
- [x] A pattern seems about 9704 ms long
- [x] I have difficulty selecting pieces of sound in Audacity. It shadows zoom gestures with selection gestures and this is quite confusing for me. Once I have my selection, trying to zoom seems to mess up the selection instead. I seem to have to squint for precision and this is not fun, because my face kinda hurts now and I am sort of irritated too.
- [x] Considered a different technique.
- [x] It seems I do want more now than previously, so it may become less easily done by just editing the wav in Audacity.
- [x] Paused for a while.
- [x] Switched to Impulse Tracker
    - [x] Adapted song in Impulse Tracker 2.14.
    - [x] Trying to output to raw or wav.
    - [x] But it output mono and too high a volume.
    - [x] Apparently I had better use Impulse Tracker 2.02 instead of 2.14. (I might conclude that from documentation from my earlier project "The CD 2005".)
    - [x] For converting an Impulse Tracker 2.14 file back to Impulse Tracker 2.02, it seems possible to save it in Impulse Tracker 2.14 as file type "2.xx".
    - [x] The command line for Impulse Tracker 2.02 to output to a file seems to be "IT s7 L128 M44100" (Derived from a file "D:\Google Drive\Program Files Dos\MUSIC\IT\IT 2.02 Disk Writer" opened in Notepad++).
- [x] Trying to maximize the volume.
    - [x] The volume is sort of halfened in the output. Perhaps maximize in Impulse Tracker.
    - [x] Used a Volume Maximizer program I made in 2005 for determining a factor by which volume might be increased to maximize the volume.
    - [x] The volume might be increased with a factor of a little under 1.39958.
    - [x] Percentage ~= 139.9
    - [x] Volumes do not seem to be increasable any further in Impulse Tracker 2.02.
    - [x] Might increase volume in Audacity.
- [x] The last piece of fade out is quite jittery. Perhaps edit that to something more clean.

### 2020-08-23 Done Adapting Song "O08V2": Slower?

- [x] Slowed down
    - [x] Speed in Impulse Tracker 2.02 used to be 160.
    - [x] Thought to decrease it with 20% to 128.
    - [x] Seemed quite a bit slow.
    - [x] Go in the middle: decrease with 10% to 144.
    - [x] Command line to output to a file: "IT s7 L128 M44100"
    - [x] Trying a 5% speed decrease instead.
- [x] Glitch: Last sounding of the sine wave seems to not cut off at the next pattern.
- [x] ~~Maximizing volume?~~
    - [x] Factor for volume maximization: a little below 1.01546
    - [x] Percentage for volume maximization: a little below 101.546
    - [x] Probably not worth it.

### 2020-08-24 Done Adapting Song "Nostalgia" ("NostGoo2")

- [x] It seemed clipped and reduced in volume, but turned out to be clipping effect.
- [x] Re-recorded with Impulse Tracker with 128 sample channels instead of 64.
- [x] Command line to output to a file: "IT s7 L128 M44100"
- [x] Somehow turned out too fast: Imported as 32-bit by accident.
- [x] Use Volume Maximizer to determine volume factor for maximization.
- [x] Volume factor might be slightly under 102.17%
- [x] Apparently I used distortion from a program called Sound Forge, so maybe not easily reproducible.
- [x] Trying to increase volume inside Impulse Tracker by 2.5x to cause distortion effect, but it did not.
    - [x] Original volume: 31
    - [x] New volume: 81
- [x] Trying a distortion effect from Audacity:
    - Distortion type: Hard Clipping
    - Clipping level: -14.89
    - Parameter controls: both 50

### 2020-08-24 Done Adapting Song "Bussel2"

- [x] Recording again in Impulse Tracker with 128 sample channels instead of 64.
- [x] Remove silence at the end.

### 2020-08-24 Done Album Details

- Artist name: "DJayJ"
- Album name: "OLDMUS~1"
- Song names:
    - Might keep the original file names without leading number or file extension.
    - Or use the song name from inside the Impulse Tracker file, if it exists.
    - The Bussel2 song was originally called TryOut4 ~~, which I might like better, because Bussel is a public place where I played it once.~~

Bussel2 might not be a good first song.
Desecration and Silent Madness might be switched between 2nd and 3rd place.
O8V2 might go first.

### 2020-08-25 Done Release

- [x] Releasing with EmuBands.
- [x] EmuBands would like a photo.
- [x] Licensing project files.
    - [x] I cannot seem to find what kind of license would be ok for a music production project.
    - [x] I could rewrite an MIT license.
    - [x] And then maybe publish the project files anyway.
    - [x] ~~Then ask people in my electronic network if they know how to more properly license it?~~
    - [x] Or maybe stop after "rewrite MIT license" and let it go.
    - [x] ~~Doubt: It might permit someone to re-release it, perhaps make a CD, perhaps make money off it it, that I do not receive. But so what? Making money wasn't really my goal and the music's originals would already be available more conveniently. I think I just should not worry about it. That would seem best. I just want to share my work freely, if anyone would be interested.~~
- [x] Project files on GitHub.
    - [x] Changing name of project from "Publish Music 2020-08" to "JJs Music Release 2020-08" so the repository name could become "JJs-Music-Release-2020-08".
- [x] Clearing Google Drive trash can.
- [x] Drafting up message for on Facebook for instance.
- [x] Promo code for 10% commission
    - [x] Ask EmuBands if I can mention is on my social posts later and other details.
- [x] Waiting till it is ready at EmuBands and the stores.
- [x] Posts and links:
    - [x] Spotify link somewhere at the top of this readme might be useful.
    - [x] Putting the post message inside the description of the GitHub repository, might make the repository more informative on its own.
- [x] Making GitHub repository public.
- [x] Posting on FaceBook, LinkedIn and friend chat group.
